  "I have a degree in Software Engineering from the University of Computer Indonesia and I am interested in Software Development, Web Development, Software Architecture and related areas. <br><br> I started in the technology area when I was a teenager, even without knowing that I was manipulating javascript, html and css I used them to make adjustments in an RPG blog. After that I took a technical course where I learned basic computer and programming concepts and realized that this is what I wanted to do.",
